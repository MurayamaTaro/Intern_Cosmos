Denmaru, the round red character, jumps straight up on a pure white background with knees barely bent and feet pressed tightly together. Near the apex, he slightly tucks his body, but his feet never separate and his torso remains facing the camera at all timesâ€”no horizontal tilt or rotation, only vertical movement. Then he immediately bends his knees slightly to land firmly on both feet, with the entire soles touching the ground, and comes to a complete stop without any bounce. His arms and hands stay fixed at his sides, with no swinging or shifting. The camera is fixed directly in front, keeping his full body in frame. Lighting is minimal so that only a faint shadow appears on the floor. The entire motion must be one continuous, smooth action without any distortions, noise, or cuts between frames.
