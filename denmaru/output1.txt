Denmaru stands on a pure white background with feet together, then performs a very small hop—just lifting a few centimeters off the ground. The camera is fixed straight on, keeping the full body in frame. In mid-air, Denmaru’s round shape remains intact; upon landing, the legs bend ever so slightly. The motion should be smooth and continuous, without any distortions or frame breaks.
