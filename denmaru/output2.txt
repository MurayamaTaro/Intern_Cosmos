Denmaru, the round red character, lightly crouches on a pure white background and then jumps straight up smoothly. In mid-air, his spherical form remains intact, briefly pausing at the apex, then immediately bending his knees slightly to land firmly on both feet. After landing, he absorbs the impact with his knees and comes to a complete rest while maintaining his round shape. The entire motion should be continuous and fluid, without any frame-to-frame distortions or cuts. The camera is fixed, always capturing his full body from the front.
