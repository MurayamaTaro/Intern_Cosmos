A sports car accelerates smoothly along a coastal highway at sunset. The camera follows behind, capturing the reflections of the sun on the glossy curved body. The suspension gently compresses as the car takes a slight curve, tires gripping the asphalt with subtle deformation. Waves crash against the nearby rocks as seagulls fly overhead.
